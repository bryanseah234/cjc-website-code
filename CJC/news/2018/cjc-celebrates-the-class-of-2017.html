Not satisfied with just doing well in all his major examinations in CJC, he shared his knowledge by giving impromptu peer tuition and was known for giving out his personal study notes to those who sought his help. He also served the wider college community as President of the Student Council. He devoted his time and energy to the organisation and execution of school-wide events that enriched college life for the community. For instance, he was driven by his desire to give his JC1 juniors the warmest welcome the CJC family could give through Orientation 2017, and worked tirelessly to conduct planning meetings, trainings and rehearsals. He sought ground feedback and spearheaded the review of practices which benefited the students such as the review of the “white shoe” policy in CJ. As a people-person, Derrick derives satisfaction and joy from making a positive difference in the lives of others, and for his outstanding achievements, he was named the Arts Valedictorian for the cohort of 2017.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><i>“While the journey may bring you feelings of regret or doubts here and there but just remember that as the sun rises, the sun will set as well.

Unfazed by academic disappointments at the O levels and JC1 examination, he strove to persevere and excel in both his studies and his contributions to college life. Given his natural curiosity, he took up opportunities to learn outside the classroom by participating in various academic workshops and conferences such as the JC Law Programme and Model United Nations. On top of juggling his studies, Sean also served the college community as a leader who won the hearts and minds of his peers. As a Sports Leader and House Captain in his graduating year, he ran extra rounds with those who were struggling in their fitness tests, organised college-wide events to enrich college life for the community, and led Michael House to victory as House Champion. An amiable and sociable young man, Sean was also an indispensable part of his home class and served his classmates as a Pastoral Care Councillor by lending a listening ear to them.</div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><i>“Whatever you are doing, just give it your 100%, especially for the CCA leaders.

His resilience was put to the test when he had to adjust to the JC curriculum and learn how to use new educational software to access learning.&nbsp; A highly motivated individual with a clear sense of purpose, he is driven to excel by his strong belief that people with disabilities should be given similar opportunities to strive for success. His presence in CJC breaks new ground in mainstream education for others like him, and challenges the perception that people with disabilities are incapable of contributing to the community. As an active participant in college life, he was a Student Facilitator at the 2017 Pre-University Seminar, guiding the participants in their discussion of active citizenry. Ian is a joy to be around and a true inspiration to all who have met him in his college years.</div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><i>“One of the things that helped me to achieve my goals was confidence in the decisions I made [knowing that if] consequences were to follow … I have the confidence to shoulder them as well because it's my own choice and to trust in my own pace regardless of what everyone else was doing or how far ahead they seemed to be.”</i><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><i><br></i></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2018/A%20level%20release%20of%20results%202018/students/Yeo%20Shao%20Jie.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Yeo Shao Jie.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left" style="width: 326px; height: 488px;"></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><b style="background-color: initial;">Robin Yeo Shao Jie</b><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><div style="line-height: 22.4px;">Robin is a a good-natured, sincere and resilient leader. During his time in CJC, his classmates regularly looked to him for advice and support. He is able to empathise, connect and work well with others. As a Student Councillor, Robin served as the Head of Department for the Catholic Activities Wing with distinction. He was very dedicated and led with passion and initiative. Together with the members of the Catholic Activities Wing, Robin organised weekly morning Masses for the college as well as major activities such as Faith Formation prayer and reflection, the Tree of Life during Lent, Ash Wednesday Mass and National Day Mass. His high self-expectations were exemplified when he planned for these sessions, where he left no stone unturned in the execution of these events and constantly sought to influence his team mates towards a common goal. Robin also participated in Model United Nations Conferences both nationally and CJC, which allowed him to enhance his public speaking skills and heighten his grasp of political issues plaguing our world. He received an Honourable Mention award at both conferences. In 2017, he sought to heighten his international exposure by participating as a delegate at the Harvard Model Congress Asia, held in Hong Kong. With an openness and tenacity to take on challenges head on, Robin has been a source of motivation for his peers, and for his outstanding achievements, he was named the Science Valedictorian for the cohort of 2017.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;"><br></div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;">“I will miss the Catholic environment in CJC.

She broadened her academic interests by participating in various Model United Nations Conferences, and her skill and effort was recognised via the many accolades she received, such as Best Delegate and Best Academics. Her passion for issues concerning social justice drove her to participate in What’s NExt?, a conference on National Education, and gain insight on governance by completing a work attachment at the Land Transport Authority. As a well-spoken, mature individual who has considerable knowledge of current affairs, she had the privilege of being a moderator for several student dialogues with the nation’s Permanent Secretaries and Ministers, and acquitted herself admirably by being able to process questions quickly and respond appropriately within a short period of time. It was unsurprising that Natasha also put her public speaking skills to good use as a Student Facilitator at the 2017 Pre-University Seminar, guiding her group through the issue of sustainable transportation in Singapore. In class, Natasha demonstrates the same capacity for deep thinking and is unafraid to play the role of the Devil’s Advocate during class discussions, which has fostered her capacity for analytical and reflective thinking and spurred her classmates on to more engaged learning.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;">“Seeing all of [my classmates] work so hard and how they are motivated by their own goals and own pursuits gave me more drive to pursue my own goals and achieve excellence together.”</div><div style="font-style: italic;"><br></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2018/A%20level%20release%20of%20results%202018/students/Rachel%20Huang.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Rachel Huang.JPG" class="ive_eobj_right" style="width: 336px; height: 502px;"></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><b style="background-color: initial;">Rachel Clarissa Huang Yan Lee</b><br></div></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><div style="line-height: 22.4px;">Rachel’s grit and determination are her greatest strengths. She sets high standards for herself and is unafraid of the hard work necessary for her to attain her goals. Rachel’s steadfast and positive attitude towards her studies was repeatedly recognised via the achievements she garnered during her time in CJC. She was awarded the Edusave Certificate of Academic Achievement 2016 and Cashew Edusave Merit Awards 2016. Furthermore, she was also awarded CJC’s 2016 Subject Prize Winner for H2 Literature in English and H1 Project Work (Individual). In 2017, Rachel was among the top performing students for General Paper, Literature in English and Geography in the Preliminary Examinations. Despite her stellar academic achievements, she remained down-to-earth and was well-liked by her peers because of her wit and humour and the authenticity of her relationships with others. She actively offered support to her peers by engaging them in collaborative learning and by initiating the consolidation of notes and revision materials. As the key leader in the main organising committee for the Overseas Service Learning Project (OSLP) in Cambodia, Rachel was able to establish trust and camaraderie among her team members, and contributed to building meaningful relationships among her team members in order for them to be collectively passionate in achieving their shared aims. Rachel also served as the Interact Club’s President from 2016-2017 and fostered stronger bonds amongst her fellow members. In class, Rachel stood out for the originality and depth of thinking she displayed via her responses and the questions she posed, which contributed to a dialogic classroom beneficial for the learning of all her classmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;"><br></div><div style="font-style: italic; line-height: 22.4px;">“Coming to CJ has been rewarding because of my friends and the opportunities I have been given not as a student leader but as a student.

Shihara has a deep passion in the English language, and reveled in her study of Literature and English Language and Linguistics. As an Ministry of Education (MOE) English Language Elective Scholar, Shihara was attached to Julia Gabriel Centre for a work attachment stint. Her love for writing extended to her CCA, where she was President of the Editorial Club. With an eye for detail, she successfully planned and executed Good English Week 2016, together with her club members in CJC. This event was targeted at raising the colleges’ awareness about World Englishes and sought to instill a deeper appreciation for the English Language. Firm in her belief in nurturing those under her leadership, Shihara initiated a collaboration with Victoria Junior College’s Editorial Club so that the respective teams could interact and they could all learn different journalistic writing styles from each other. She was an influential leader in her CCA, and was able to garner respect to rally the team towards her vision. Shihara’s innate desire to push herself beyond her comfort zone saw her participating not only in the internally-held CJC Model United Nations, where she represented the delegate USA but also in the esteemed Harvard Model Congress Asia hosted in Hong Kong, both in 2017.</div><div style="line-height: 22.4px;"><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px;"><i>“I will miss the culture and environment in CJ.

Placed in the Ignite Programme, Rachel developed critical thinking skills and is adept at evaluating the innate complexities of problems. Her tutors have remarked that her work is of high quality and displays a critical nous. She is also an eloquent speaker, delivering persuasive presentations at the Model United Nations Conferences where she received the Honourable Mention award in 2016 and was recognised as the Best Delegate in 2017. Rachel balanced her academic pursuits with her commitment to her sport. As Captain of the CJC Fencing Team, she took the initiative to mentor her juniors and her leadership capabilities were recognised when she received the Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership, and Service in 2016. Additionally, she is invested in serving the wider community; she devoted time to engaging children in games and learning activities during her class-based Service Learning Project and devised creative strategies to raise public awareness as a Conservation Ambassador for Wildlife Reserves Singapore from 2014 to 2016.</div><div style="line-height: 22.4px;"><br></div><div style="line-height: 22.4px;"><i>“I believe that being clear about your purpose really helps.&nbsp; It's not that you need to have&nbsp; career plan to be motivated.
