the achievements of the Class of 2018. “Their achievements stand testament to
their growth mindset, resilience, teamwork and commitment to serving the
college and the community-at-large. The college would like to congratulate the
students who showed tremendous grit in attaining their success. We give thanks
to God for His blessings on the Class of 2018. We encourage this cohort to stay
true to their mission and to constantly seek new opportunities to realise their
dreams.” <br><br>Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice Principal, added, “Our
heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2018 on their results. We hope and
pray that you continue to embody the CJC spirit of Truth and Love as you
continue to light the way for others and for yourselves.” <br><br>The college would like to extend its heartfelt
appreciation to the teachers and support staff, the Parent Support Group, the
School Management Committee and the alumni for their generous support and
prayers for the students. <br><br>The college congratulates and celebrates the

for the benefit of her peers. She often seeks to understand the perspectives of
others. For her diligence and commitment to her studies and commendable
progress in her subjects, Vivian was conferred academic awards such as the Ministry of Education Edusave Good Progress Award in 2017, as well as
several college academic achievement awards throughout both years. As
Vice-President of Guitar Ensemble, Vivian was tasked with the responsibility of
planning and managing weekly CCA sessions, as well as wielding the baton as secondary
student conductor for her peers. Her leadership role helped her develop
resilience and initiative and remain level-headed in the face of challenge and
opportunity. Vivian held herself to high standards and did not compromise on
the quality of her work. She strives to consciously adopt a growth mindset by
taking on challenges that help push her past her current capabilities in order

He dreams of contributing to the academic world through research and development in the area of Chemistry.<br><br><i>“During my time in CJ, I realised that there are many students who
underestimate their potential and as a result, do not work hard enough to
achieve their goals. So, to the juniors - do not get affected by your
shortcomings but take ownership of your learning and push yourself to do better. Prioritise your
learning over things that may not necessarily be important and then focus on
your studies fully.”</i><br><br><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/Celine%20Sim%20seated.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Celine Sim seated.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

<br>Isaac exhibited the best qualities one has come to associate with a
CJCian: responsible, disciplined, caring. Not only was Isaac an exemplary student in the classroom, he
demonstrated his commitment to a holistic education by pursuing his love of
nature with the Environmental Science Society, eventually helming it as their
President. During his tenure, he
organised various recycling projects such as the Cross-Country Recycling
Project as well as a week-long newspaper collection and environmental awareness
programme during Earth Week. His teachers selected him for the Singapore
Environmental Action and Leadership (SEAL) Programme at Yale-NUS College
because of his knowledge and eagerness to learn about environmental issues. In
all the endeavours Isaac undertook, he was never one to be daunted by the scale
or the challenge of the task ahead. This included an Overseas Service Learning
Programme trip to Vietnam where he and his teammates helped to construct a
playground at a school in rural Vietnam. Isaac has a calm demeanor and is a
thoughtful individual who is observant and sensitive to the needs of others.

staff were the most important support system I had.</i>”<br><br><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2019/ALvls/Tiffany%20Tan%20seated.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Tiffany Tan seated.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;"></span><b>Tiffany Tan</b>
<br>During her time in CJC, Tiffany was a focussed and determined student
with a growth mindset and a positive attitude towards her studies. Her tenacity
and resilience saw her overcome difficulties and succeed even in the subjects
she was weaker in. A recipient of the English Language Elective Scholarship (ELES),
Tiffany was offered a work attachment opportunity with the Asian Film Archive
(AFA) where she explored her interest in graphic design and advertising.
Besides her academic pursuits, Tiffany developed sound leadership skills during
her time in college. With her strong interpersonal skills, she was elected to
the college’s 43rd Student Council. Tiffany’s strong faith and commitment to
service saw her take on the position of Head of the Catholic Activities Wing,
where she led her fellow councillors in organizing various events to promote
faith formation within the college. She was also involved in planning and
executing several major school events including Teachers’ Day, Open House 2018,
Rockafella, and Graduation Night. Tiffany’s leadership skills were further
honed during an overseas service learning project to Vietnam where she helped
to create lessons to teach the local children soft skills. She also volunteered
to be the trip’s photographer as she was eager to put her creativity to good
use. Ever helpful and optimistic, Tiffany always went the extra mile to help
her classmates in their work.

<br><br>“<i>I think it is very important to
have something to ground you no matter what your religion is and have friends
to speak with, especially when you are very stressed. My faith has helped me a
lot in my CJ journey and I was able to use my talents to serve God and the
school.</i>”<br><br><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2019/ALvls/Seated%20Joshua%20Ng.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Seated Joshua Ng.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left"><br><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;"></span><b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Joshua Ng</b>
<br>Joshua’s strength lies in his drive to excel, be it in the area of sports
or academia. He worked hard and encouraged his peers to do the same. He was a
positive influence to his peers and established strong relationships with them.
In class, he was engaged and showed an eagerness to learn.&nbsp;During his time
in CJC, Joshua was elected Vice-Captain of the Rugby Team. In his leadership
journey, Joshua developed organisational and facilitation skills by leading the
team during training sessions. He never failed to motivate the team and was
responsible for their welfare. In addition, Joshua was part of the main organising
team that planned and facilitated activities during the college’s Open House
and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Bazaar. Aside from leadership and academic
development, Joshua also participated in two college-based service learning
projects, which included an Overseas Service Learning Project in Ratchaburi
Province in Thailand in 2017. In addition, as part of his class’s Local Service
Learning Project in 2017, Joshua was involved in the Meals-on-Wheels Program
organised by Touch Community Services. He delivered meals to the home-bound
elderly, who expressed their gratitude for the meals and conversations that
they had with the students. 

&nbsp;
<br><br>“<i>I chose CJC because of God,
and by His grace, I managed to study my hardest even though I was tired. There is a lot of gratitude to all the people who have helped me
through all this and especially to God, because without him, nothing is
possible.</i>”<br><br><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2019/ALvls/Elizabeth%20Wee%20standing.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Elizabeth Wee standing.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left"><br><b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Elizabeth Wee</b>
<br>Elizabeth’s focus, determination and capacity
for criticality of thought demonstrated in her time in college was only
rivalled by her tenacity in making the most of her CJC experience. Elizabeth
adopted a holistic approach towards college life, having been President of the
college’s Symphonic Band, wherein her exemplary leadership, self-discipline,
and charisma were crucial in guiding her band towards a spirit of excellence.
Elizabeth also served in the Music Ministry as a vocalist and an
instrumentalist in school masses and important College events. Elizabeth was an
Orientation Group Leader which further developed her sense of commitment in the
arduous preparation for Orientation week. Her compassion towards others was seen
in her participation in the 2017 Overseas Service Learning Project in Vietnam,
a seven-day community involvement program, where, elected as the Second
In-Charge, she contributed greatly to the project to make a positive difference
in the lives of the children. She managed the team in the preparation and
execution of the games, lessons, physical work activities, and was a crucial
factor in the team’s success. While juggling the rigour of academic demands,
she also rallied her class to perform during Literary Evening 2018 and she was the
Director, Scriptwriter and main cast member. Their performance won ‘Best
Production’ that year. She received the Edusave Character Award in 2017 and
2018 in recognition of her exemplary discipline and character, and is a model
of the school’s values throughout and beyond her academic journey. Elizabeth’s
gentle spirit and appreciation for beauty and the arts has only complemented her
relentless drive for holistic development and she truly exemplifies a Thinker
with a Mission, Leader with a Heart. She is proof that it is indeed possible to
pursue your artistic passions and to balance it with a consistent focus on the
academic journey.

<br><br>“<i>It was amazing how everyone was able to leave
everything behind in Singapore, like the stress from school, as well as other
personal problems, and just immerse themselves in the OSLP experience. It
allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and helped me to become a better and
more compassionate person. My OSLP experience played a significant role in
improving my leadership skills as well.</i>”<br><b><br></b><img src="../../../qql/slot/u495/News/2019/ALvls/Lee%20Jen%20Chye%20seated.jpg" hspace="2" width="100%" alt="Lee Jen Chye seated.JPG" class="ive_eobj_left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><br>Lee Jen Chye</b>

National School Games. Jen Chye’s tenacity and determination to do well also
shone in his participation in the National School Games ‘A’ Divisions for Golf
where he overcame formidable competitors and clinched the 4th position in the
Individual category. Jen Chye extends his philosophy of giving his best in
every task, great or small, to his role as the class’s Subject Representative
for Economics. He rallied his classmates and encouraged them to be consistent
in their efforts for the subject. Jen Chye’s perceptive and analytical skills
drive him towards an interest in the field of actuarial sciences as he is
fascinated by the nature of the work involved. <br><br>“<i>It is the
