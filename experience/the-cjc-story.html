2018. A role model to his peers in his leadership, academic and personal
qualities, Dillen was a permanent fixture on the Principal’s Honour Roll and
was awarded a CDC-CCC Education Merit Award in 2017 and an Academic Achievement
Award in 2018. Inquisitive and uncompromisingly vocal in class, he displayed
qualities of intellectual flexibility and critical thinking skills during class
discussions. His genuine love for learning and clarity of purpose made him a
joy to teach. Besides his academic qualities, he demonstrated empathy and
compassion through his participation in the Overseas Service Learning Project
in Thailand in 2017. Together with his teammates, Dillen embarked on a journey
to create positive change in the lives of the less fortunate children in
Ratchaburi, Thailand. Dillen was also an active member of the Drama Society,
representing the College at the Singapore Youth Festival 2018, where the team
was awarded the Certificate of Distinction. His dramatic talents were also
expressed through his passionate performance in one of the lead roles at
Literary Evening 2018. Dillen displayed excellent leadership capabilities as
the Home Tutorial Councillor of his class. With enviable qualities of
self-awareness, humility and empathy, Dillen is an inspiration to many of his
peers.<br></span><b><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><br></span></b></div>

spirit of a true servant leader. Being the constant motivator and source of
inspiration for both his peers and tutors, he made an indelible difference to
the College while serving as President of the 43rd Student Council. He
displayed a clear sense of purpose in his role and composure that was unfazed
by impending difficulties and challenges. In class, Kiven would go the extra
mile to understand the concepts that were presented in class. Kiven also strove
towards intellectual development and enjoyed engaging with abstract ideas.
Furthermore, his focus on improving the environment around him and the
relationships between different groups of people, by uniting them through a
common purpose propelled him to engage the student body to craft the College
Theme for 2018. Together with other student leaders, Kiven sought to understand
both the needs of the bigger student body and the School Leaders to make
concrete plans to improve the overall college experience, uniting the entire
college body in the process. His experience leading the cohort helped him
develop as a mentor to the Student Council, which helped them to grow through
their journey as student councillors. His heart for service and social justice
was also seen when he became one of the most valuable members of his class’
Local Service Learning Project (LSLP) team. He readily extends his
understanding of service to the less privileged in society, and is moved by
what he hears and sees, eager to translate that into socially responsible action.
Kiven’s humility and earnest nature, together with his ability to lead
effectively, is what endears him to his peers and in effect, everybody around
him His outgoing nature is attenuated by his true strength which lies in
connecting with others at their level, understanding the world from their eyes,
especially their hopes and their fears.<br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: initial; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</span></div></span></div>

academic pursuits, Tiffany developed sound leadership skills during her time in
college. With her strong interpersonal skills, she was elected to the 43rd

on the position of Head of the Catholic Activities Wing, where she led her
fellow councillors in organizing various events to promote faith formation
within the College. She was also involved in planning and executing several
major school events including Teachers’ Day, Open House 2018, Rockafella, and

overseas Service Learning Project to Vietnam where she helped to create lessons
to teach the local children soft skills. She also volunteered to be the trip’s
photographer as she was eager to put her creativity to good use. Ever helpful
and optimistic, Tiffany always went the extra mile to help her classmates in

good interpersonal skills were evident in the successful Interact Club events
held under her leadership. Joanne shared that the experience has helped
developed her as a nurturing leader, as she learnt to juggle between setting a
clear direction for her peers and allowing them to grow through mistakes and
setbacks. Her compassion towards others and sense of community involvement was
seen in her contributions to Local and Overseas Service Learning Projects
(OSLP). She was in the planning committee for various local projects, such as
service in Assisi Hospice and the Autism Awareness Project. In 2017, she signed

individual, Brina has demonstrated the ability to step out of her comfort zone
in order to achieve her objectives. An independent learner who set clear
academic targets for herself, Brina pursued Literature in English at the H3 level.
The nature of the independent study required by her H3 subject developed her
skill of quality research and academic writing, and broadened her understanding
of the pursuit of literary studies. In addition, Brina was awarded the English
Language Elective Scholarship. For this scholarship, she interned at Sproud, a
video making company for three weeks. Her enthusiasm for learning led to her
involvement in several academic enrichment programmes such as the Straits Time
Forum in 2017, World Agricultural Forum in 2017 and Creative Arts Programme
(CAP), under the poetry category. Always looking for new challenges to broaden
her skillsets, she participated in the College's Literary Evening in 2018 where
she took on the role as script writer, producer and talk show panelist. Brina
balanced her academic life with a healthy involvement in Volleyball as her
Co-Curricular Activitiy (CCA) in CJC, as well as contributing as an Orientation
Group Leader (OGL) in Orientation 2018 and in the Overseas Service Learning Project
(OSLP) to Vietnam in 2017. Brina displayed adaptability and maturity in these

inquisitive learner who has shown great capacity for critical thought, often
looking beyond the boundaries of the syllabus in order to stretch her
analytical skills and participating in enrichment programmes like the Singapore
Chemistry Olympiad 2017 and the STEP NUS Brain Camp 2018. Her intellectual
curiosity and ability to quickly grasp complex concepts and complicated
technical terms have allowed her to master her subjects easily. Resourceful and
solution-oriented, Vivian is also generous with her knowledge, sharing what she
knows and has so that her peers may benefit. She often seeks to understand the
perspectives of others, an approach that stems from her sensitivity to others’
emotions and driven by a desire to cultivate a more thoughtful and
compassionate worldview. Vivian is also highly responsive in unexpected
situations, flexible and able to adapt quickly to any kind of environment. For
her diligence and commitment to her studies, and commendable progress in her
subjects, Vivian was conferred a host of academic awards such as the Edusave
Good Progress Award in 2017 as well as several college academic achievement
awards throughout both years. As Vice-President of Guitar Ensemble, Vivian
showed resilience and initiative, and remain level-headed in the face of
challenge and opportunity. She took up opportunities, such as attending the
Sunburst Leadership Camp 2017, to develop her engagement and communication
skills in order to become a better leader for her Ensemble. Vivian also
actively participated in a class-initiated local service learning collaboration
with the Housing Development Board (HDB) which aimed to promote inclusiveness
and good neighbourliness within the community. She strives to consciously adopt
a growth mindset by taking on challenges that help push her past her current
capabilities in order to become a better individual.</span></span></span></div></span></div><o:p></o:p><p></p></div>
